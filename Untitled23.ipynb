    "Elastic Net Regression is a type of regularized regression that combines the penalties of both Lasso (L1 regularization) and Ridge (L2 regularization) regression. This combination helps address some of the limitations of each individual method. Unlike Ridge regression, which shrinks the coefficients of correlated predictors towards each other, and Lasso regression, which can perform variable selection by shrinking some coefficients to zero, Elastic Net strikes a balance between them, making it suitable for scenarios where there are many correlated predictors."
